Artists maximize the value of their work by capturing recurring revenue through a profit-sharing model with their NFT collectors.</p><p>We do this by building a blockchain-based ecosystem where the authenticity of physical garments is guaranteed and copyright licenses can be transferred and utilized transparently and efficiently through copyright-embedded NFTs. </p><p>Art comes to life, not just through a sculpture, framed wall art, or a digital NFT, but here also through apparel - transforming artwork into utilitarian consumer products and artists into their own brands. Given the opportunity, we believe consumers would rather be a walking billboard for the artists that they love than for the powerful, damaging brands that they are forced to choose among to clothe themselves. </p><p>If you're an artist, your most serious collectors and supporters want to invest in you and tell everyone about their investment in you and how much they believe in you. In the past, they could do this only by purchasing and displaying your art at whatever particular private location on earth they chose to place it. Speculators might buy your work, hoping the value goes up if you die. And in any case, you only make money at the time of the initial sale.</p><p>For artists in our <em>stitched.eth</em> ecosystem, your collectors can invest in NFTs that have the capability of bringing your art to the streets, and you get paid for it every time this happens. You can get more, and more deeply-connected collectors, collectors can earn a real return on their investment in your art, and consumers get accessible art that they can showcase on their bodies every day.</p><h3><a id="problems-solved"></a>What problems does this solve?</h3><p>Artists have traditionally relied on some combination of private collectors, patrons, non-profits (like museums) or state-sponsored entities (such as municipalities or other government entities) to raise money for projects and to make a living. </p><p>This creates an inherent power-imbalance, where artists rely on powerful institutions or wealthy individuals for financial support. Artists can get exploited, artists themselves may feel pressure to compromise their vision, and artists also often spend their valuable time negotiating gallery contracts, sales and marketing or else applying to governments or institutions and managing complicated bureaucracies. </p><p>Furthermore, for many artists, it can be prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to create a recurring revenue model where the artist can have a little bit financial breathing room. Printing can be expensive and requires marketing time and expense or gallery markups. </p><p>The traditional dynamic does not provide much financial incentive for your collectors and patrons to invest in you or your work. Right now, galleries are the typical gatekeepers who do this kind of work. Galleries do not always make the best gatekeepers... </p><p>Private collectors often just "buy and hold," sometimes squirreling away the artist's work in a private residence that few have access to or even a storage space where almost no one can view it. This does a disservice to both the artist and the collector. Taking away the public's ability to view the work limits the reach of the work, and this hinders both the artist's means to communicate and the public's appreciation for the message. </p><p>Pricing art for sale to collectors and patrons is challenging as well. Artists typically need to make sure that original art is priced high enough to cover their costs and living expenses, but artists also don't want to limit their art to only collectors who have lots of money. Collectors, on the other hand, are not incentivized to spend as much money on art as other traditional investments because there is no available cash flow from owning the art itself and conveyance of the art gives no additional rights. This depresses the amount of money people are willing to pay for art.</p><p>Using apparel as a medium creates a mechanism to spread the artwork to the public at scale, but it is typically cost-prohibitive for artists because of the high minimum order quantities required to appreciate a reasonable margin and the complicated copyright-brokering process. The powerful institutional clothing brands have limited incentive to work with artists they don't "own" and extract a significant amount of value away from the artists, and sometimes even creative control.</p><h3><a id="why-participate"></a>Why should artists participate?</h3><p><em>stitched.eth</em> solves these <a href="#problems-solved">problems</a> by making it free for our artists to join the ecosystem and making the copyright-licensing process completely transparent. Furthermore, artists are empowered with the ability to choose their own markup for the licensed garments. </p><p>The physical garments are easily authenticated for the resale market, and the artist can rely on their collectors and patrons to spend the money and time on marketing.</p><p>Collectors and patrons purchase the artwork NFTs, and these NFTs provide a valuable right for their holders - the right to produce a certain amount of physical garments per year. Collectors have every incentive to invest in both promotion of the artist and of the specific design, as the value of the NFT would theoretically increase with their investment.</p><p>Artists benefit both indirectly from the collector's promotion investments and directly when from the sale of the garments allocated to that NFT since the artists are in charge of the reproduction and pricing of the reproductions.</p><p>We have created a mechanism to align the incentives - to create economic <em>interdependency</em> in an ecosystem that economically benefits the patrons. Human nature being what it is, when it makes economic sense, it usually happens a lot faster and more efficiently than people who only support artists out of the kindness of their hearts (or perhaps for more nefarious reasons).</p><h3><a id="money"></a>Where does the money go?</h3><p>NFT holders are limited by the terms of their copyright license to order their allocations of physical garments directly through the artist. This means that the artist and the collector have to negotiate directly, and the money flows from the collector directly to the artist. <em>stitched.eth</em> does not take a cut of any money paid to the artist for the allocations.</p><p>Accordingly, since the agreement for the physical garments is made directly between the artist and the collector, the artist has an obligation to deliver the goods according to the terms of that agreement. </p><p>The only source of revenue for <em>stitched.eth</em> is from the initial sale of each NFT in the series and a percentage of each subsequent resale. </p><h3><a id="copyright"></a>What copyright does the artist give to <em>stitched.eth</em>?</h3><p>The artist licenses the exclusive right to reproduce this design on apparel to <em>stitched.eth</em>. By virtue of doing this, the artist does lose the right to reproduce that piece on any other clothing, but the artist maintains the rights (1) to use the design on any other medium, (2) to refuse to produce the design for any particular licensee, and (3) to use any other designs on apparel that haven't also been licensed. </p><p><em>stitched.eth</em> then sub-licenses this exclusive right among a series of NFTs. The specific number of NFTs may change, but right now the number is 15 (to be clear, once the series is minted, no more can be added to that NFT series - the specific number of NFTs in each series will be established and permanently fixed at the time of minting). Therefore, no one else in the world can reproduce the specific design on clothing except for the holders of those 15 minted NFTs. The sub-license further restricts the NFT-holder's reproduction rights by: (1) limiting the number of reproductions per year - usually 100 per year - except that the number of reproductions can accumulate over the years (these are the "design allocations") and (2) restricting the person who can actually manufacture the reproductions to the artist who created the design. </p><p>Accordingly, the artist can say "no" to any particular design request, but the artist cannot do any reproductions of the work without the approval of an NFT holder. The NFT holder must then negotiate directly with the artist to get the design manufactured. In the event that the artist and the NFT holder cannot agree on a reproduction run, then the yearly allocation goes unused, continues to accumulate with the NFT, and the NFT holder may choose to retain the NFT or sell it to someone else who can then use the allocation. </p><p>Whenever the artist accepts an order (and gets paid for it, at prices determined by the artist), then the artist produces the reproduction and delivers it to the NFT holder. <em>stitched.eth</em> deducts the design allocations from the NFT by updating the corresponding NFT's webpage (the location of which is embedded in its metadata) and register each reproduction by minting an NFT. The physical goods must be conferred together with the NFTs in order for them to be considered authentic. </p><p><em>stitched.eth</em> maintains the NFT addresses for all the world to see right here on this decentralized website. All of the updates are hashed on IPFS, so even if every core dev dies off in a plane crash, the IPFS hash will remain for anyone else to take over the project or confirm a garment's authenticity. </p><h3><a id="apply"></a>How do I apply as an Artist?</h3><p>If you're interested in joining us as an artist, tweet us @stitchedeth or DM us on instagram @stitched.eth</p><p>Make sure you read these FAQs so that you know what you're getting into!</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-wrap"><div class="post__share"><h3 class="h6">Share this:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstitchedeth.github.io%2Fens%2Fartist-faqs%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstitchedeth.github.io%2Fens%2Fartist-faqs%2F&amp;via=%40stitchedeth&amp;text=Artist%20FAQs" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstitchedeth.github.io%2Fens%2Fartist-faqs%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Artist%20FAQs" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstitchedeth.github.io%2Fens%2Fartist-faqs%2F" class="js-share mix" aria-label="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstitchedeth.github.io%2Fens%2Fartist-faqs%2F" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Artist%20FAQs https%3A%2F%2Fstitchedeth.github.io%2Fens%2Fartist-faqs%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><a class="logo" href="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/"><img src="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/media/website/Design_1-400px-wide.png" alt="Stitched.eth"></a><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/stitchedeth" class="twitter" aria-label="Twitter"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://instagram.com/stitched.eth" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">This is a decentralized website owned by Stitched.Eth and powered by the Ethereum Name Service.</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth:'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar',};</script><script defer="defer" src="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=d8bb48654f2e33126209a5cc5c435313"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>

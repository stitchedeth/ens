The medium of choice for this muralist is wheat paste. For gallery-based work, mixed media and acrylic/aerosol are commonly used. </p><p>Known to use several types of paper (from wax blueprints, vintage music sheets, WWI journal entries, etc.) in his works, PREACHER experiments with the concepts of familiarity through realistic portraits and characters in combination with text. Though based in the “bible-belt” of the Southeast, PREACHER's plethora of work is not religiously charged. A visual dialogue is created in most of his works, drawing from themes of economics and commonly accompanied with aggressive sticker, moniker, and wheat pasting techniques.</p><p class="align-left">From the artist: </p><blockquote><div class="align-right" dir="auto">I have always had an issue with writing my name on things. The public domain is where I am most free to express myself. My thoughts are unconfined. My movements unrestricted. My work is designed top evoke feeling in the viewer. It is designed to breathe power and self-being into the viewers.</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div class="align-right" dir="auto">You can either find me painting in the field or in the privacy of my</div><div class="align-right" dir="auto">home, painting on canvas. Although texture rarely varies, canvas</div><div class="align-right" dir="auto">provides a platform for permanent and semi permanent work; not just temporary.</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div class="align-right" dir="auto">My current self-exploration has mainly been composed of acrylic paint, usually limited to black and white.  Aerosol, however, has been the backbone to my work for years. The combination of the two has allowed me to revisit my past and cross compare it with the present.</div></blockquote><p>The artist may be contacted on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/preacherart/">@preacherart</a></p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/media/posts/9/Preacher-Logo-black-on-transparent-background.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/media/posts/9/responsive/Preacher-Logo-black-on-transparent-background-xs.png 300w, https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/media/posts/9/responsive/Preacher-Logo-black-on-transparent-background-sm.png 480w, https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/media/posts/9/responsive/Preacher-Logo-black-on-transparent-background-md.png 768w, https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/media/posts/9/responsive/Preacher-Logo-black-on-transparent-background-lg.png 1024w, https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/media/posts/9/responsive/Preacher-Logo-black-on-transparent-background-xl.png 1360w, https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/media/posts/9/responsive/Preacher-Logo-black-on-transparent-background-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="1105" height="268"></figure></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>This decentralized website is powered by the Ethereum Name Service and built on IPFS,</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://stitchedeth.github.io/ens/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
